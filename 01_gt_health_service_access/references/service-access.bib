  Abstract                 = {It is frequently stated—and more frequently assumed—that the dispersed settlement of a rural population results in isolation and a substantial physical separation from modern-sector health services. This study shows that for three large departments in western Guatemala—Sololá, Tolonicapán, and San Marcos—the vast majority of persons have reasonably good physical access to health services, even taking bad roads and slow travel times into account. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health has strategically located its facilities in congruence with rural market centers, and virtually the entire population visits these market centers with great regularity. Analysis of 1800 actual patient visits, however, shows that Ministry facilities have minuscule geographic drawing power, that is, the vast majority of patients come only very short distances. The question is raised: Why? Although no definitive answer is provided here, the most plausible explanation is simply that the health posts—which are understaffed by poorly trained personnel and badly under-equipped—do not cure very well, and thus people are not highly motivated to use them. Improving levels of utilization depends on improving the quality of delivered services, not building more health posts or overcoming supposed ‘cultural barriers’. },

  Abstract                 = {Surveys have attempted to measure married women's decision-making power by asking women who has a say and/or final say in a number of household decisions. In several studies where the same questions were posed to husbands, considerable discrepancies in reports were found. This paper assesses husband and wife reports of decision-making on four matters (whether or not to buy household items; what to do if a child becomes ill; whether or not to buy medicine for a family member who is ill; what to do if a pregnant women becomes very ill) and the relationship of these reports to three recent health behaviors (having an emergency plan during pregnancy; delivering in a health facility; having a postpartum checkup within 4 weeks). A sample of 1000 women in 53 communities in three departments of western Guatemala was selected using a stratified random sampling approach. A standard household questionnaire was used to identify the respondents as well as to obtain data on household characteristics. Husbands of interviewed women were interviewed in every other household giving information on 546 couples for this analysis. Women and men's questionnaires were similar and were designed to obtain information on the respondent's knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding maternal health. Consistent with other research, results show that relative to their husbands’ report, wives tend to under-report their household decision-making power. In couples with both partners educated and in couples in which women work for pay, both partners were significantly more likely to report that both of them participate in the final decisions than was the case in couples without education or in which the wife did not work for pay. Women's reports of their decision-making power was significantly related to the household having a plan for what to do in case of a maternal emergency, but was not associated with place of childbirth or with having a postpartum checkup, while husband's reports of the wife's decision-making power was negatively associated with the likelihood of having the last birth in a health facility. },

  Abstract                 = { In developing countries, lack of trust in the quality of care provided is often cited as a major factor promoting reluctance to seek biomedical help for obstetric emergencies. This article draws on fieldwork among Mayan informants in Sololá, Guatemala, to explore poor perceptions of the quality of care received when seeking obstetric care in the hospital. Using data collected over two years, I set out to understand why interviewees repeatedly complain that hospital staff “do not attend to you.” I maintain that the powerlessness of patients to influence the treatment they receive further reduces their trust in the quality of care delivered, ultimately negatively impacting the decision to seek obstetric care. Finally, I argue for the importance of recognizing the influence of the wider historical and social context in creating the dynamics of this interaction. The implications of this research in defining the quality of care and skilled attendance within the quest to make pregnancy safer are discussed. },

Formal care was sought for nearly half of severe pneumonias but only for 27% within 2 days of onset, with 31% and 18%, respectively, for severe diarrhea. In multivariable analysis, factors independently associated with formal care seeking were knowing the Community Emergency Plan, mother?s perception of illness severity, recognition of World Health Organization danger signs, distance from the health center, and having someone to care for family in an emergency.Conclusions. Proximal factors associated with recognizing need for care were important in determining formal care, and were strongly linked to social determinants. In addition to specific action by the health system with an enhanced community health worker role, a systems approach can help ensure barriers are addressed among poorer and more remote homes.

  Abstract                 = {This paper explores the content, prevalence, and determinants of husbands’ involvement in two aspects of their wives’ maternal health: (1) providing advice and care during pregnancy and (2) attending birth. Using primarily women's reports of their spouses’ involvement taken from qualitative and survey data from a sample of rural Guatemalan households, I find that husband participation is relatively high compared to some expectations and that the dynamics of male involvement differ between the two aspects. The analysis of receiving advice or care from husbands during pregnancy, an analysis done only among women who experienced a complication during pregnancy, suggests that the type of prenatal care sought and the quality of the familial and marital relationships are important factors. On the other hand, husbands’ attendance at birth seems driven more by men's availability and access to birth. Together, the data show that “male involvement” is not a singular behavior and point to ways to conceptualize its complexity. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The floating catchment area (FCA) family of metrics employ principles from gravity-based models to incorporate supply, demand, and distance in their characterization of the spatial accessibility of health care resources. Unlike traditional gravity models, the \{FCA\} metrics provide an output in highly interpretable container-like units (e.g., physicians per person). This work explores two significant issues related to \{FCA\} metrics. First, the Three Step Floating Catchment Area is critically examined. Next, the research shows that all \{FCA\} metrics contain an underlying assumption that supply locations are optimally configured to meet the needs of the population within the system. Because truly optimal configurations are highly unlikely in real-world health care systems, a modified two-step floating catchment area (M2SFCA) metric is offered to address this issue. The \{M2SFCA\} is built upon previous \{FCA\} metrics, but allows for spatial accessibility to be discounted as a result of the suboptimal configuration of health care facilities within the system. The utility of the new metric is demonstrated through simulated data examples and a case study exploring acute care hospitals in Michigan. },

  Abstract                 = {Background Surveillance is essential to estimating the global burden of pneumonia, yet differences in surveillance methodology and health care-seeking behaviors limit inter-country comparisons. Methods Results were compared from community surveys measuring health care-seeking for pneumonia defined as: (1) cough and difficulty breathing for ⩾2 days; or, (2) provider-diagnosed pneumonia. Surveys were conducted in six sites in Guatemala, Kenya and Thailand; these sites also conduct, active, hospital- and population-based disease surveillance for pneumonia. Results Frequency of self-reported pneumonia during the preceding year ranged from 1.1% (Thailand) to 6.3% (Guatemala) and was highest in children aged &lt;5 years and in urban sites. The proportion of persons with pneumonia who sought hospital-based medical services ranged from 12% (Guatemala, Kenya) to 80% (Thailand) and was highest in children &lt;5 years of age. Hospitals and private provider offices were the most common places where persons with pneumonia sought health care. The most commonly cited reasons for not seeking health care were: (a) mild illness; (b) already recovering; and (3) cost of treatment. Conclusions Health care-seeking patterns varied widely across countries. Using results from standardized health care utilization surveys to adjust facility-based surveillance estimates of pneumonia allows for more accurate and comparable estimates. },

Current implementations of the 2SFCA method are static in that they consider centroid-based night-time representations of the population. The proposed enhancement to the 2SFCA approach addresses this limitation by accounting for trip-chaining behavior. The presented method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of daycare centers in the province East Flanders in Belgium. The results show significant spatial differences in accessibility between the original and commuter-based version of the 2SFCA (CB2SFCA). They highlight the importance of giving heed to more complex travel behavior in cases where the need for detailed accessibility calculations is apparent. },

  Abstract                 = {This study examines factors associated with the use of biomedical care during pregnancy in Guatemala, focusing on the extent to which complications in an ongoing or previous pregnancy affect a woman's decisions to seek care. The findings, based on multilevel models, suggest that obstetrical need, as well as demographic, social, and cultural factors, are important predictors of pregnancy care. In contrast, measures of availability and access to health services have modest effects. The results also suggest the importance of unobserved variables–such as quality of care–in explaining women's decisions about pregnancy care. These results imply that improving proximity to biomedical services is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on utilization in the absence of additional changes that improve the quality of care or reduce barriers to access. Moreover, current efforts aimed at incorporating midwives into the formal health-care system may need to extend their focus beyond the modification of midwife practices to consider the provision of culturally appropriate, high-quality services by traditional and biomedical providers alike. },

Poverty is a serious constraint on a family's choices about how to treat children's illnesses, whereas education and ethnicity have little effect on treatment behavior when income is held constant.

  Abstract                 = {Background

During the past two decades, health interview surveys have become an increasingly common source of information about current morbidity patterns and utilization of health services in developing countries. This study describes a recent effort to enhance the utility of these surveys by incorporating a calendar format.
Methods

A calendar of morbidity and treatment behaviour during the 2-week period prior to interview was implemented in the Guatemalan Survey of Family Health (EGSF), a large-scale sample survey that was fielded in 60 communities in rural Guatemala in 1995. A total of 2872 women aged 18–35 were interviewed and provided information on 3193 children born since 1990.
Results

The EGSF calendar data provide estimates of diarrhoeal illness that are consistent with those obtained from more conventional questionnaire designs. However, in contrast to conventional health survey questions, these calendar data: (1) permit a much more complete evaluation of the accuracy of reporting; and (2) offer a richer and more complex description of child illness and treatment behaviour. For example, the results demonstrate that even the preferred 2-week recall period suffers from underreporting of diarrhoeal illness, that the majority of children with diarrhoea experience at least one additional symptom, and that mothers assess severity of diarrhoea from the type and number of accompanying symptoms.
Conclusions

The findings indicate that additional implementation and evaluation of calendar formats is warranted in order to provide the most useful and accurate data possible at relatively low cost.},

The calendar provides a much richer description of child illness and treatment behavior than do conventional data typically collected in health interview surveys. The resulting estimates reveal that Guatemalan children experience high rates of diarrheal and respiratory illness and that these illnesses often involve multiple symptoms that only partially overlap one another. In addition, estimates from the calendar demonstrate that the measurement of illness frequency is fairly complex and that classification of illness into distinct categories may not always be feasible or meaningful. Results regarding treatment behavior indicate that the vast majority of illnesses are treated and that mothers almost always receive advice regarding their children’s illnesses from relatives. On the other hand, health providers are sought for advice and treatment in only about one-third of illnesses. When families do seek providers, they are more likely to rely on biomedical ones — especially pharmacists, doctors and personnel at health posts and centers — than traditional practitioners. By far, the most common form of treatment — recommended by both relatives and providers — consists of readily available Western medicines. In contrast, the use of traditional remedies appears to be relatively low. },

While some biomedical services are available in these communities, many Maya utilise traditional medicine as a significant, if not primary, source of health care. While existing medical anthropological research characterises these modes of medicine as medically dichotomous or pluralistic, our research in a Maya community of the Western Highlands, Concepción Huista, builds on previous studies and finds instead a syncretistic, imbricated local health system. We find significant overlap and interpenetration of the biomedical and traditional medical models that are described best as a framework where practitioners in both settings employ elements of the other in order to best meet community needs. By focusing on the practitioner’s perspective, we demonstrate that in addition to patients’ willingness to seek care across health systems, practitioners converse across seemingly distinct systems via incorporation of certain elements of the ‘other’. Interventions to date have not accounted for this imbrication. Guatemalan governmental policies to support local healers have led to little practical change in the health-care landscape of the country. Therefore, understanding this complex imbrication is crucial for interventions and policy changes. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The accessibility to medical facilities plays an important role in the overall health system of a country. Accessibility often refers to spatial or physical accessibility and is concerned with the complex relationship between the spatial separation of the population and the supply of health care facilities. There is a need to understand the current health care needs and also the existing practices. The traditional planning approach for rural transportation believes that building roads would ensure access to various infrastructure and services by motorized vehicles. However the impacts of such investments on rural development and also on health care have been found to be extremely mixed. Therefore an attempt has been made to quantify the impact of such investments on health sector. Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) program, an Indian Government initiative is an example of one such investment. The accessibility to medical facilities of the villages connected by \{PMGSY\} roads is compared to villages which are not connected by any means, so that the effect on accessibility in the presence of a well constructed road can be determined. Quantifying accessibility in terms of health care contributes to a wider understanding of the performance of the health systems which in turn helps the policy decision maker(s) in identifying the deficiencies of the system so that remedial measures could be taken. However, it would be incomplete if the distance (or travel time), quality of service provided at the health care center and affordability of the users are not considered while quantifying accessibility. Therefore by integrating all the important factors influencing accessibility along with multi criteria decision making tools, a methodology is developed. This methodology includes three different multi-criteria decision making analysis tools: Simple Additive Weightage (SAW), Fuzzy aggregation method and Fuzzy preference decision analysis. Further these three methods are critically analyzed for their suitability to quantify accessibility to medical facilities. },

  Abstract                 = {This article examines the relationship between migration and the use of formal maternal health-care services among rural women in Guatemala. We identify assimilation, diffusion, and remittances as three potential pathways through which migration can affect health-care service utilization in rural areas. Using data from the 1995 Guatemalan Survey of Family Health and multi-level regression models, we estimate the impact of migration experience at the individual, household, and community level on the use of formal prenatal care and delivery assistance. We find that urban migration experience and having relatives abroad are associated with a greater likelihood of formal prenatal care utilization, after taking account of background characteristics and enabling resources. Migration experience at all levels is also strongly associated with formal delivery assistance; however, this association operates primarily through the positive association between migration and enabling resources. The differential effects of out-migration on maternal health-care service utilization reflect the different barriers to service use that exist for formal prenatal care and delivery assistance. Financial cost and geographic access are the most important barriers to formal delivery assistance, whereas awareness and acceptance remain as important barriers to the use of formal prenatal care in rural Guatemala. Urban migration experience and social ties to urban and international migrants lower the barriers to formal maternal health-care utilization through the acquisition and diffusion of new ideas and practices, and the return flow of financial resources. },

Based on the framework of the 2 Step Floating Catchment Area Method (2SFCAM), we proposed an innovative method to incorporate transportation modes into the accessibility estimation. Taking Florida, USA, as a study area, we illustrated the implementation of the multi-mode 2SFCAM, and compared the accessibility estimates with those from the traditional single-mode 2SFCAM. The results suggest that the multi-modal method, by accounting for heterogeneity in populations, provides more realistic accessibility estimations, and thus offers a better guidance for policy makers to mitigate health inequity issues. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method continues to be a popular measure of spatial accessibility, especially in relation to primary-level health care. Despite its popularity, most applications of the 2SFCA method are limited by the utilisation of only a single catchment size within a small geographic area. This limitation is significant to health policies which are mostly applied at the state or national scale. In this paper, a five-level dynamic catchment size was trialled within the 2SFCA method to all of Australia, with a population's remoteness used to delineate increasing catchment sizes. Initial trial results highlighted two perverse outcomes which were caused by sudden changes in catchment sizes between each level. Further refinement led to trialling an additional three-level catchment sub-type to the 2SFCA method, which created a smoother transition between remoteness levels. This study has demonstrated an effective approach to dynamically apply variable and more appropriate catchment sizes into different types of rural areas, which for the first time enables the 2SFCA method to be suitable for national-level access modelling and its potential application to health policy.},

Based on this literature review a research agenda is put forward, identifying knowledge gaps that transport researchers can help to fill. These knowledge gaps pertain to the need for more spatially disaggregated, individualized and temporally-aware accessibility metrics, more sophisticated geocomputational tools to operationalize such metrics and improved measurement of equity considerations in empirical research.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective to identify and better understand factors that influence care-seeking behaviour for women's health among indigenous Mayan populations in the highlands of Guatemala. Design adaptation of qualitative anthropological methods involving observations, key informant interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). Setting Project Concern International's Casa Materna, Huehuetenango, Guatemala. Participants Interviews and \{FGDs\} were conducted among 21 clients (current or past) of the Casa Materna and traditional birth attendants; 17 female advocates/promoters of the Casa Materna and related services; and 12 male advocates, including spouses, non-government organisation staff and community health workers. Findings the following findings emerged from focus group data: Women's support groups (WSGs) provided an enabling environment in which women could form friendships, bond, discuss concerns about their reproductive health, and identify concrete ways of addressing them; Supportive friends, family members and advocates influenced women's decisions to seek health care at the Casa Materna; Women's decisions to seek care were often associated with their sense of self-worth and self-esteem, and women's self-esteem was enhanced by their participation in the WSGs; Women's decisions to seek care were influenced by the perception that women would be able to access culturally appropriate, safe and secure health care services at the Casa Materna; The learned behaviour of negotiation with key decision-makers and/or opinion leaders was an effective tool for convincing such individuals of the value of accessing facility-based care; The proven track record, high quality of services and cultural competence offered at the Casa Materna increased the confidence and level of trust of clients and their family members about the care that would be received; Couple-based education and health promotion were effective techniques for achieving behaviour and attitude change among both men and women. Key conclusions the Casa Materna and its community outreach strategy serve an essential purpose in the provision of maternity care for the isolated and vulnerable families of the Guatemalan highlands, by bridging traditional and Western approaches to health care services. The Casa Materna service model plays a critical role in improving women's self-efficacy and ultimately strengthening the social fabric that characterises this high risk and vulnerable population. Implications for practice the Casa Materna model provides a foundation upon which to bridge and strengthen the relationship between community advocates, traditional community-based health care providers, and the government-funded system of health care. The findings of this study should be incorporated into future research to determine the potential for bringing the model to scale. },

  Abstract                 = {Considerable efforts were made in Guatemala to cover rural areas with health centres, and health programmes have been launched to treat and prevent the most important childhood diseases. Despite this, the utilization rate of public health services has reportedly been low throughout the past two decades. How, and how effectively, do mothers resolve the health problems of their children? To gain better insight into health care behaviour, we conducted a health services utilization survey in two highland communities in the department of Sacatepequez in 1992–1993.We asked 324 mothers in two villages whether, and where, they had sought help the last time their children under 5 years of age had suffered from diarrhoea, fever, cough symptoms or worms. Mothers relied on home care in 63–83% of reported episodes and the use of health services—Western or traditional—was consistently low. Although Western health care was easily accessible, it was used in only 8–15% of cases. The only identifiable significant independent determinants of utilization were occupational status of the mother (RR=1.5 if employed) and overall level of socioeconomic development of the community (RR=1.7).Inquiry into treatments used revealed that except for worms, which were frequently treated with herbs (31%) or external remedies (20%) alone, modern pharmaceuticals predominated. Antibiotics were the remedy of choice against diarrhoea (63%), antipyretics in case of fever (83%) and cough syrups with expectorants or antitussives against cough (65%). One hundred and twenty-one of the children born after 1975 died; in only 64 cases (53%) was a Western health service consulted between onset of disease and death.No relation was found between attendance and socioeconomic characteristics of the parents, but a positive linear association between duration of the fatal illness episode and age of the child could be identified. Independent sources report a drop in infant mortality of 53 and 35% respectively in the two communities between 1977 and 1991. Our findings seem to indicate that this reduction was achieved despite under-utilization of Western health services.},

  Abstract                 = {In November 1994, a retrospective survey was conducted for two purposes: to investigate patterns of health-care uptake for childhood and maternal illness in semi-urban Guatemala; and to gain an insight into the expenditure incurred by the subjects when they consulted the various health-care providers.

The subjects, who all belonged to a semi-urban ladina community, had easy geographical access to the health-care providers, of all types, operating in Sacatepequez, in the central highlands of Guatemala. The community was divided into clusters of roughly equal population size and 20 of these were selected. Within each selected cluster, eight households that had at least one young child (< 5 years of age) were investigated. Mothers belonging to each household were asked whether, how frequently, and where they had sought outside help for any health problem that had possibly affected them or their children during the past year. Subsequently, they were also invited to recall the expenditure incurred on the last visit, if any, to each type of health-care provider established in the area.

The crude utilisation rates, for all providers combined, were 1.0/women.year and 0.8/child.year. Overall, 61% of women had no uptake of curative care for themselves and 12% of families no such uptake for their children. Lay curers and clinics run by non-governmental organizations were hardly utilised. Drug vendors accounted for 38% of contacts by women and 26% by children, private physicians for 34% and 38%, and public services for 22% and 33%, respectively. The utilisation rate of the official sector attained roughly 0.3/person.year in both women and children. Dissatisfaction with the treatment received and the lack of drugs were often given as reasons for not attending public services. The median total expenditure incurred per curative, health-care contact ranged from 0 quetzales in the official health centres to 63 quetzales with private physicians (a U.S.$ being equivalent to 5.5 quetzales at the time of the study). Although, for each type of provider (except the health centres), expenditure was nearly equal for a woman or for a child contact, it consisted of a different mix of cost elements (consultation fee, drugs and transport) for each of the various categories of provider.

The willingness to pay for private, curative care, demonstrated by >75% of the studied households, opens perspectives for a more prominent role of the public sector. It would seem that there is, in the socio-economic environment of semi-urban Sacatepequez, room for experimenting with alternative modes of health-care financing to increase the quality and attractiveness of public services and their utilisation.},

  Abstract                 = {Two commonly used metrics for assessing progress toward universal health coverage involve assessing citizens’ rights to health care and counting the number of people who are in a financial protection scheme that safeguards them from high health care payments. On these metrics most countries in Latin America have already “reached” universal health coverage. Neither metric indicates, however, whether a country has achieved universal health coverage in the now commonly accepted sense of the term: that everyone—irrespective of their ability to pay—gets the health services they need without suffering undue financial hardship. We operationalized a framework proposed by the World Bank and the World Health Organization to monitor progress under this definition and then constructed an overall index of universal health coverage achievement. We applied the approach using data from 112 household surveys from 1990 to 2013 for all twenty Latin American countries. No country has achieved a perfect universal health coverage score, but some countries (including those with more integrated health systems) fare better than others. All countries except one improved in overall universal health coverage over the time period analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {This study attempts to identify and describe factors associated with the choice of a health care source in rural Guatemala. Because of limited choice options, rural Guatemala makes an excellent location for studying the factors that affect utilization patterns. Illness case histories were collected from a random sample of 270 households in six villages. Then, two different methodological approaches were used to predict treatment actions. First, a sociobehavioral model, which encompasses enabling, predisposing, and need factors, was used to predict treatment choices. Using discriminant analysis we identified factors associated with the use of home remedies, a pharmacy, the health post, a physician, or folk healer. In a second, parallel study, descriptive interviews were used to identify important factors in choosing a treatment strategy. From these interviews, and from responses to hypothetical illness cases, we developed a decision model of treatment actions. Both models were tested against the set of illness cases. Results indicate that both approaches identify similar variables (especially, severity), although selection of variables through the multivariate analysis was much more successful in predicting treatment actions, [treatment choices, Guatemala, Latin America, decision model, health services utilization]},
