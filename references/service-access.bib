  Abstract                 = {It is frequently stated—and more frequently assumed—that the dispersed settlement of a rural population results in isolation and a substantial physical separation from modern-sector health services. This study shows that for three large departments in western Guatemala—Sololá, Tolonicapán, and San Marcos—the vast majority of persons have reasonably good physical access to health services, even taking bad roads and slow travel times into account. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health has strategically located its facilities in congruence with rural market centers, and virtually the entire population visits these market centers with great regularity. Analysis of 1800 actual patient visits, however, shows that Ministry facilities have minuscule geographic drawing power, that is, the vast majority of patients come only very short distances. The question is raised: Why? Although no definitive answer is provided here, the most plausible explanation is simply that the health posts—which are understaffed by poorly trained personnel and badly under-equipped—do not cure very well, and thus people are not highly motivated to use them. Improving levels of utilization depends on improving the quality of delivered services, not building more health posts or overcoming supposed ‘cultural barriers’. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The floating catchment area (FCA) family of metrics employ principles from gravity-based models to incorporate supply, demand, and distance in their characterization of the spatial accessibility of health care resources. Unlike traditional gravity models, the \{FCA\} metrics provide an output in highly interpretable container-like units (e.g., physicians per person). This work explores two significant issues related to \{FCA\} metrics. First, the Three Step Floating Catchment Area is critically examined. Next, the research shows that all \{FCA\} metrics contain an underlying assumption that supply locations are optimally configured to meet the needs of the population within the system. Because truly optimal configurations are highly unlikely in real-world health care systems, a modified two-step floating catchment area (M2SFCA) metric is offered to address this issue. The \{M2SFCA\} is built upon previous \{FCA\} metrics, but allows for spatial accessibility to be discounted as a result of the suboptimal configuration of health care facilities within the system. The utility of the new metric is demonstrated through simulated data examples and a case study exploring acute care hospitals in Michigan. },
